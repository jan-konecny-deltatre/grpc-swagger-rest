# grpc-swagger-rest

This is a very simple example of creating REST API with Swagger for gRPC service. In order to test just clone the repository and run the application. 
The REST api and Swagger are completely generated based on the gRPC .proto file. Service also has gRPC reflections enabled so its easier to test gRPC call on itself.
